We are Tbilisi JS - a professional community, open to all, that brings together frontend and Node.js developers in Tbilisi, along with a wide range of digital professionals - UI/UX designers, QA engineers, DevOps and accessibility specialists, HR and IT recruiters, product managers, analysts, and managers. What unites us all is an interest in technology and progress, a love for knowledge, a desire to share experience and context, and a solid commitment to supporting each other in professional development and growth!

We organize meetups and conferences to foster a vibrant community where people can network, learn, and collaborate.
